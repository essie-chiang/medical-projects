# rabbitkeras
keras model of dose rabbit paper 

* Better accuracy:
- [ ] basing on UNet++, compared U1, U2, U3 ... 
- [ ] add multi transformation of base dataset (paper: Image deformation using moving least squares)

- [ x ] original model of paper reproduce
- [ x ] add simple model export and import for inference
- [ x ] support FLAGS specify with command line
- [ x ] psnr accuracy add to model training accuracy
- [ ] ssim accuracy add to model training accuracy
